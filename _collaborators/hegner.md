### Biography

Benedikt Hegner is experimental physicist and computer scientist working as staff scientist at [CERN](http://home.web.cern.ch/)'s [EP-SFT](https://ep-dep-sft.web.cern.ch/) group. He is a software enthusiast and expert for highly parallel data processing applications and facilities.

He received his Ph.D. in Experimental Particle Physics from Hamburg University, working for the [Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS)](https://cms.cern) experiment at the [Large Hadron Collider (LHC)](http://home.web.cern.ch/topics/large-hadron-collider). As CERN scientist, he worked on developing and designing data processing applications for a range of HEP experiments at CERN, [KEK](https://www2.kek.jp/accl/eng/index.html), and for the studies for the [Future Circular Collider](https://fcc.web.cern.ch/). In 2018/2019 Benedikt Hegner spent a scientific sabbatical at [Brookhaven National Laboratory](https://bnl.gov) and was Deputy Director of their [Scientific Data and Computing Center](https://www.sdcc.bnl.gov/). Since 2019 he is adjunct faculty a the [Insitute of Advanced Computational Science](https://iacs.stonybrook.edu/) of the [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu/).

Nowadays, he works on the experiment-independent [Key4hep](https://key4hep.github.io/key4hep-doc/) software stack and is a leading member of the [HEP Software Foundation](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/), promoting common solutions to the software and computing challenges for the HL-LHC and beyond.
