### Biography

Brij Kishor Jashal is a scientist working in the domain of experimental particle physics, scientific computing and research software. His current research focuses on the
[Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS)](https://cms.cern) and [Large Hadron Collider beauty (LHCb)](https://lhcb-outreach.web.cern.ch/) experiments at the
[Large Hadron Collider (LHC)](http://home.web.cern.ch/topics/large-hadron-collider) at the [European Laboratory for Particle Physics (CERN)](http://home.web.cern.ch/).
At [Tata Institute of Fundamental Research](https://www.tifr.res.in/), Department of Atomic Energy, his responsibilities include building, managing and operating large scale scientific computing infrastructure, software and services for High energy Physics.
In addition, he is a research scholar of Experimental Particle Physics at [Instituto de Física Corpuscular](https://webific.ific.uv.es/), [University of Valencia](https://www.uv.es/) working at [LHCb](https://lhcb-outreach.web.cern.ch/) experiment.
In past he has been a Research Scientist at [India Space Research Organization (ISRO)](https://www.isro.gov.in/), where he made key contributions in the development of  [India Water Resource Information System](https://indiawris.gov.in/wris/#/), a project of national importance.

### Project interests

He has been in the lead role of managing the national computing centre for High Energy Physics which includes Tier-II and Tier-III centres for researchers of CMS collaboration under the aegis of [The Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG)](https://home.cern/science/computing/grid).
He is also a member of [WLCG Grid Deployment Board](https://wlcg.web.cern.ch/collaboration/management/grid-deployment-board) representing India.
In addition, He is currently a Level-2 convener of Monitoring & Analytics group under CMS Offline and Software computing. This group is responsible for analysis, processing and dissemination of complex monitoring datasets of multiple sources from CMS computing services, processes and infrastructure

His research at [LHCb](https://lhcb-outreach.web.cern.ch/) experiment has been focused on Study of rare radiative b decays, trigger strategies for long living particles, Real Time Analysis, High Level Trigger (HLT) frameworks and algorithms on Hybrid computing architectures.
