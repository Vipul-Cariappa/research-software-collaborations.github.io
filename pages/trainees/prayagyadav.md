project_title: Building examples for Future Circular Collider (FCC) analyses using the Columnar Framework For Effective Analysis (COFFEA) framework and developing the schema class implementation of FCC simulation samples in COFFEA
project_goal: >
  The purpose of this project is to build the necessary schema class for FCC simulation samples in COFFEA and create examples of simple analyses done in COFFEA utilizing FCC simulation samples. The schema classes for the NanoAOD data structure are already present in COFFEA. Developing a schema class for FCC samples would enable analyses to be performed in Python and take advantage of parallel processing with less time-to-insight. Based on the existing examples of FCC analyses, COFFEA examples of the same are to be built and documented, which will streamline the reproducibility of the results.
