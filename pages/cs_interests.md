## Computer Science Synergies/Interests

This page is meant to capture some areas where high-energy experimentalists have
built successful collaborations with computer scientists and data scientists. This 
list is by no means exhaustive or exclusive of areas where a successful collaboration
has been or could be established.
  * High throughput computing and distributed computing - workflow organization and scheduling; orchestration of compute across physical sites.
  * Data management and compression techniques - how do we organize large amounts of data and move it to where it is needed.
  * Python ecosystem - novel data analysis and science tools and techniques
  * Machine learning / Artificial Intelligence - methods for data analysis, data processing and simulation
  * High performance computing 
  * Interactive computing: Development of LLVM compiler toolchain and interoperability 
  * Probabilistic programming / Automatic differentiation methods. Developing differentiable pipelines with HEP tools; replacing tranditional tools and techniques with those better suited for optimization techniques 
  * Software for heterogeneous computing environments (eg, techniques and algorithms appropriate for efficiently using GPUs)
