# Open projects for IRIS-HEP Fellows (and more)

This page lists a number of known software R&D projects of interest to IRIS-HEP researchers.
(This page will be updated from time to time, so check back and reload to see if new projects
have been added.) Contact the mentors for more information about any of these projects! Be sure
you have read the [guidelines](https://iris-hep.org/fellows.html).

You can also find open projects for other programs or of general interest.
Use the pulldown menus to select projects based on their attributes. Projects may instead specify
that they are appropriate for multiple options (or any option) for a given attribute.
Click the triangle next to each project for more information (if provided by the project mentors).
